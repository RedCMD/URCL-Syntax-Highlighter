## Features
Highlights URCL based instructions, headers, macros, labels, opperands and comments.  
Adds snippets for all instructions and headers. (Use tab to cycle through)  
Only highlights opperands based on their position relative to the instruction.  
Will try its hardest to find the correct opperand within the whitespaces.  
All invalid code is highlighted in red.

## Requirements

This extension was designed with VSCode's default Dark+ theme in mind.  
Other themes may work with various successes.  

## Known Issues

Many.  
Comments are very very cursed.  
Will have to code up a language server of some sort to fix it.
